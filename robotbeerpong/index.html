    <h3>About RBP</h3>
    <p>In Robot Beer Pong, teams write RISC-V machine code that controls a robot to play beer pong against other teams who did the same thing; each time your robot 'drinks', bits are randomly flipped and the robot gets more <i>silly</i>.  Uploading your code to this site will automatically enter you into the competition.  To see your code playing, go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5agq3Ecu9hfiI0XkI4r6A">YouTube livestream</a>.</p>

    <h3>RBP Nitty-Gritty</h3>
    <h4>Turns</h4>
    <p>Robot Beer Pong is turn based.  At the beginning of your robot's turn, the ball is place on your magnet, the <code>PC</code> is set to zero, and your code executes until you call <code>EBREAK</code>.  Once you call <code>EBREAK</code>, code execution terminates, the ball is released, and Newton takes over.</p>
    <p>You have 5 seconds to complete a turn and the processor runs at a speedy 1kHz.</p>
    <h4>Fixed Point Arithmetic</h4>
    <p>RBP uses fixed point arithmetic, rather than floating point; this allows it to implement a smaller subset of the RISC-V architecture.  Every number is stored as an integer that is exactly 1/1024 of its decimal value.</p>
    <h4>The Robot</h4>
    <p>In RBP, you interact with the robot solely through CSR registers.  Various important values related to the robot are mapped to CSR registers.  The following table displays all of these</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tr>
        <th>Address</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Waist Angle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Arm Angle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Hand Angle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Waist Angular Velocity</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Waist Angular Velocity</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Waist Angular Velocity</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>Waist Torque</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>Arm Torque</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>Hand Torque</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>Configuration</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>All of the values are stored as radians in fixed point (see above), except for the configuration (see below).  Torques are read/write; everything else is read-only, except for configuration, which is sometimes writable (see below).</p>

    <h4>Configuration</h4>
    <p>The configuration is a 32-bit binary word representing the current position of all of the cups.</p>
    <p>The lowest order bit represts whether the board is 'flipped' or not.  The following images show the bit corresponding to the cup in each position; they are with a 0 and 1 low order bit respectively.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <img class="col-6" src="./images/cupdiagramnum.png"/>
      <img class="col-6" src="./images/cupdiagramnumflip.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>Notice therefore that <code>0x000026fe</code> is the classic beer pong 10 cup configuration.  The top 13 high order bits are ignored.</p>
    <p>The configuration can always be read, but it can only be written to once per game until two cups remain, when it becomes permanantly read/write.</p>
